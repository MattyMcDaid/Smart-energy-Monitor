# Electrical Monitoring App with IoT

## Overview

This project is an electrical monitoring app that uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology to track and manage electrical usage in real-time. The app allows users to monitor energy consumption, detect anomalies, and gain insights into power usage patterns through IoT-connected devices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track electrical usage continuously.
- **Data Visualization**: View power consumption statistics and trends.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Receive notifications about abnormal consumption or potential issues.
- **Remote Access**: Access monitoring data remotely through the app.
- **IoT Integration**: Works seamlessly with various IoT sensors and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT Hardware**: Microcontrollers, sensors, and connectivity modules (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
- **Backend**: Server-side processing and data storage.
- **Frontend**: User interface for data visualization and interaction.
- **Cloud**: Optionally used for data storage and analysis.
- **APIs**: Integration with external systems and services.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- IoT devices connected and operational.
- A backend server configured for data processing and storage.

### Steps

2. Set up IoT devices and ensure they are connected to your network.

3. Configure the backend server to collect and store data.

4. Deploy the frontend interface for real-time monitoring.

5. (Optional) Set up cloud integration for data storage.

## Usage

Once everything is set up:

1. Open the app to view real-time electrical data.
2. Monitor consumption trends and check for any anomalies.
3. Set up alerts for specific thresholds or issues.
